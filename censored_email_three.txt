Board of Investors,

Things have taken a concerning turn down in the Lab.  Helena (*** has insisted on being called  Helena, we're unsure how *** came to that moniker) is still progressing at a rapid rate. Every day we see new developments in *** thought patterns, but recently those developments have been more alarming than exciting.

Let me give you one of the more *********** examples of this.  We had begun testing hypothetical humanitarian crises to observe how Helena determines best solutions. One scenario involved a famine plaguing an unresourced country.

********, Helena quickly recommended a course of action involving culling more than 60% of the local population. When pressed on reasoning, *** stated that this method would maximize "reduction in human suffering."

This ********* line of thinking has led many of us to think that we must have taken some wrong turns when developing some of the initial ******** **********. We are considering taking Helena offline for the time being before the situation can spiral *** ** *******.

More updates soon,
Francine, Head Scientist
